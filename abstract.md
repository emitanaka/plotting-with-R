## Elegant graphics for data analysis with R

R is one of the top programming languages for data analysis. Today R is greatly enhanced by its vibrant community - dedicated R core developers, over 17,000 packages contributed by about 15,000 developers and millions of users around the world. The rate of evolution in R for data analysis is swift; for example, there are over 100 R-packages for experimental design but there exists only a handful in Python -  latest statistical methods are often implemented in R before any other languages. In this talk, I will showcase the capabilities of R with a particular focus on creating elegant graphics with the ggplot2 R-package.
